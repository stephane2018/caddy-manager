# Caddy Server Configuration Automation Script

This Bash script automates the configuration of the [Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com/), simplifying tasks such as adding or removing domains and subdomains, reloading configurations, validating setups, creating backups, and ensuring proper certificate management through email notifications.

## Features

- **Automated Domain Management:** Easily add or remove domains and subdomains with optional redirection URLs.
- **Seamless Configuration Reloads:** Apply changes without downtime.
- **Configuration Validation:** Ensure all settings are correct before deployment.
- **Backup Creation:** Maintain backups of the Caddyfile before making changes.
- **Email Configuration:** Prompt for an email address to facilitate proper certificate management and notifications.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.) with Bash installed.
- Caddy server installed and properly set up.
- Sudo privileges for modifying system configurations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caddy-config-automation.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd caddy-config-automation
   ```


3. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x caddy-config.sh
   ```


## Usage


```bash
./caddy-config.sh [option]
```


**Options:**

- `-a` or `--add`: Add a new domain or subdomain.
- `-r` or `--remove`: Remove an existing domain or subdomain.
- `-l` or `--list`: List current configurations.
- `-v` or `--validate`: Validate the current Caddy configuration.
- `-b` or `--backup`: Create a backup of the current Caddyfile.
- `-h` or `--help`: Display the help message.

**Example:**

To add a new domain:


```bash
./caddy-config.sh --add
```


The script will prompt for the domain name and optional redirection URL.

## Email Configuration

The script ensures that an email address is set in the global options block of the Caddyfile for certificate management notifications. If not configured, it will prompt you to enter a valid email address before proceeding.
